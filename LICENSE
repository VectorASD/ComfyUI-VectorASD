This project includes a reconstructed and modified version of a JavaScript snippet originally used to build a tree structure from safetensors metadata, as seen in the Hugging Face repository:
https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/tree/main/split_files/text_encoders
The original JavaScript was miniified and not explicitly licensed. It was translated into Python with the assistance of Microsoft Copilot and further adapted by VectorASD. This code does not render the tree as a table; it constructs a nested structure from safetensors keys for internal use.
Note: In the original Hugging Face interface, this tree is only visible after clicking the "layers" icon next to the safetensors file. The reconstructed logic replicates the underlying structure, not the visual behavior.
If you are the original author and wish to clarify licensing or attribution, please open an issue.
